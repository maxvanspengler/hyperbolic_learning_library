## Installation

The Hyperbolic Learning Library was written for Python 3.10+ and PyTorch 1.11+. 

It's recommended to have a
working PyTorch installation before setting up HypLL:

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) installation instructions.

Start by setting up a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

```
python -venv .env
```

Activate the virtual environment on Linux and MacOs:
```
source .env/bin/activate
```
Or on Windows:
```
.env/Scripts/activate
```

Finally, install HypLL from PyPI.

```
pip install hypll
```
